<h2>A Little About Me</h2>

<p>Hey!! I'm Kashvi. I'm currently pursuing BTech in Data Science from NMIMS College. I have done some internships in the finance segment as well and I love to experience and learn new things. </p>

<p>I'm often asked to shut up because i blabber too much but I dont shy away to share my opinion on anything and everything ;/ I also love to dance and sing and someday, hopefully I can give these hobbies of mine more time in my future. </p>
